        </p><br><p>The standard flow of research usually looks something like this. There are a lot of text and images available, and we usually have some task that we want to do with them. Whether it's predicting a label from an image, or learning how people feel from Reddit posts, the average research lab doesn't have the resources required to develop and host a robust annotation tool. And so we run into bottlenecks, and are slow to move forward to our goal. Let's talk about each of the steps, and how DocFish is going to help us.</p>

		<h4 class="card-title btn btn-warning">Step 1: Organize your data</h4>
		<p class="card-text">Getting the data, and moving it around is usually hard. This is why we have linked DocFish to the over 1.5 million articles (images and text) in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/tools/openftlist/" target="_blank">Pubmed Central Open Access Subset</a>. Using the <a href="https://www.github.com/vsoch/wordfish-standard" target="_blank">WocFish standard</a>, you can zip up your data, and upload it to a <a href="{% url 'new_collection' %}">new collection</a>, and you are ready to go. What does the standard look like? It's just a <a href="http://vsoch.github.io/wordfish-standard/examples/demo2" target="_blank">simple organization</a> of images and text files in folders on your computer. If you need help validating a dataset, we provide <a href="https://asciinema.org/a/101745?speed=2">a tool</a> to do that, driven by the <a href="https://github.com/vsoch/som" target="_blank">Stanford Open Modules</a> for Python.</p>

	        <h3>Annotation</h3>
                <p class="card-text">Annotation means that you want to ascribe a specific label to some text or all or part of an image. Usually, we want to annotate datasets for supervised machine learning, because we want to use features from the text or image to predict the label. In the case of annotation, we want to define a clear set of labels to use, each with one or more options (e.g., label "disease" has options "present" and "absent." DocFish provides an easy way to do this, for either text or images.
                 <ul>
                    <li>Define labels for your collection</li>
                    <li>Send out a link to annotate images or text for those labels</li>
                 </ul><br>
                <h3>Markup</h3>
                <p class="card-text">Markup is like freehand drawing. Whether you are looking at text or an image, it means that you are free to circle or highlight an idea to indicate something general like "this is important." An image markup task might ask a radiologist to circle an area of interest, and this area might be used to direct an unsupervised classifier to focus on an area of an image. A text markup task might mean asking a political scientist to highlight the sentence(s) that were most convincing for a report. A markup gives the user freedom to select or highlight information. Using DocFish, after you upload your data, you can do different kinds of markup:
                 <ul>
                    <li><strong>Describe</strong> means that the user can write openly to describe an image or text. For example, you might ask a user to write about how a painting makes him or her feel.</li>
                    <li><strong>Markup Images</strong> means that the user can draw freely on your image. You can provide any (or no) instruction on how you want this done. An overlay is saved with the markup with a matching image, so you can carry the markup and image forward to your machine learning task.</li>
                    <li><strong>Markup Text</strong> This comes down to highlighting words or chunks of text. For example, we might ask a user to highlight ingredients in a recipe, and then train a classifier to do the same.</li>
                 </ul><br>

		<h4 class="card-title btn btn-info">Step 3: Download your data for Machine Learning</h4>
		<p class="card-text">Once your data is in DocFish, the annotations, markups, and original images are available via our <a href="/api">API</a> for you to use programatically for machine learning. You can also export your dataset from the interface, or link up directly with cloud machine learning services (under development).</p>
